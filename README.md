# Świat Anny

## About

A commercial website designed to place orders for images and facilitate user interaction via a contact form for enquiries. In addition, an order processing form was integrated, ensuring that users receive an email confirmation after placing an order.

The offer and opinions section were implemented using Supabase. In order to broaden my skills and learn new tools, I decided to work with GraphQL and the Apollo client for this part of the project. This experience gave me an insight into a modern and efficient approach to data management.
